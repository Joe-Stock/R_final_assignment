##Data Inspection
For data inspection, I first copied the files from the [BCB546X repository](https://github.com/EEOB-BioData/BCB546X-Fall2017) to my [Assignment repository](https://github.com/dormilon/R_final_assignment) and inspected the folder:
```{r}
file.info(dir("Original_files/"))
```

```{r}
genotypes <- read.table(file = "Original_files/fang_et_al_genotypes.txt", sep = "\t", header = T)
snp <- read.table(file = "Original_files/snp_position.txt", sep = "\t", header = T)
```
